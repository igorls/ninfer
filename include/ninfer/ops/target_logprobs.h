/**
 * Op: Target token log-probabilities
 *
 * Math / indexing:
 *   Let l[r,c] be the exact real value represented by logits[r,c]. For every column c and every
 *   target slot t,
 *
 *     ideal[t,c] = l[target_ids[t,c],c]
 *                  - log(sum_{r=0..valid_rows-1} exp(l[r,c])).
 *
 * Logical shapes:
 *   logits is [physical_rows,C]; target_ids and output are both [C] (one target per column, T=1)
 *   or both [T,C] with 1<=T<=256, the T slots of a column contiguous. C>0 and
 *   1<=valid_rows<=physical_rows. Values in target_ids are in [0,valid_rows). Physical rows
 *   [valid_rows,physical_rows) do not participate in either the denominator or target lookup.
 *
 * Supported domain:
 *   logits is contiguous finite BF16, target_ids is contiguous I32, and output is contiguous
 *   FP32. Storage has its dtype's natural alignment.
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   output is the FP32 numerical approximation of ideal. Reduction association and private
 *   accumulator precision are implementation choices; the independent oracle evaluates the full
 *   formula in FP64 from the represented BF16 inputs.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Writes every output element and preserves both inputs. Output must not overlap logits or
 *   target_ids.
 *
 * Workspace:
 *   None.
 *
 * Execution:
 *   Enqueues work on stream and owns no persistent state.
